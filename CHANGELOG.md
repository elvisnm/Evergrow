### Tweaks

- Inventory, vendors, skills, journals and menu panels share frosted glass that picks up the scene behind them.

### New

- Level 20 characters can start ten-dungeon expeditions at settlement map tables, choosing routes as they explore.
- Larger expedition dungeons feature eight encounter modifiers and increasingly strong enemies, with treasure after each clear.

- Enchanters can reset your skill tree for 25 gold per refunded skill point.

### Tweaks

### Fixes

- Large dungeon fights run more smoothly, especially when enemies from several rooms pursue you together.
- Expedition rewards and return visits preserve route progress without granting completion twice.
