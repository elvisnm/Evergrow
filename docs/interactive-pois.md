# Interactive points of interest

Local regional scaling, 2026-09-08: New trials capture a bounded regional level at activation for every wave and reward. All event types are eligible from level one; new low-level recipes include their ranked final guards. Existing started/completed trials retain their source levels and rewards. See [regional scaling](region-scaling.md).

Local addition: [wilderness boss lairs](wilderness-bosses.md) add three bosses, Elite/Veteran retinues and automatic Rare-or-better hoards through a separate placement layer. Existing landmark identities and save formats remain unchanged.

Updated 2026-09-07. This local pass adds recipe-driven encounters, six new landmarks and timed cursed chests. All tuning remains subject to player testing. [World placement](wilderness-and-encounters.md) and [dungeons](dungeons.md) share the same geographic levels and reward owners.

## Activities

| Watchtower | Two-second beacon channel | Reveal nearby terrain and one distant landmark |
| Graveyard | Three guardian waves or three seals | One equipment roll and XP |
| Standing stones | Choose a blessing; defend the circle through two waves | A 90-second build bonus and XP |
| Roadside reliquary | One-second opening | Small coin cache; 25% chance of an item |
| Cursed chest | Clear increasingly large waves within 90 seconds | More completed waves produce more items and gold |
| Ruined chapel | Break three ritual anchors or fight tomb guardians | Grimoire/amulet rolls and gold |
| Beast den | Destroy three nests or fight hunting packs | Leather chest/boots and gold |
| Quarry | Fight crystal guardians or hold the extraction site | Weapon/armor rolls and gold |

| Contested crossing | Break a blockade or defend the cache | Equipment and gold |
| Corrupted grove | Cleanse three roots or defend the heartwood | Caster equipment and gold |

The seed selects each site's recipe. These are one-time character-owned encounters; revisiting never rerolls or resets them. All new landmarks appear in discovery, map hover and Journeys. The compact active-trial label shows the current wave, casualties and, where relevant, remaining time or hold progress.

## Reusable waves

`event-recipes.ts` owns immutable mode, roster, wave count, growth, time and hold rules. `wave-system.ts` is a pure clock/progress engine. Admission, AI, deaths, persistence and rewards remain separate owners.

- Assault: defeat every admitted member; two seconds between waves.
- Defense: defeat the wave and spend twelve cumulative seconds inside the marked objective. Leaving pauses hold progress.
- Seals: defeat the current wave, then interact with its reachable objective before the next wave. Three distinct anchors are checked and saved when starting.
- Timed: ninety seconds of active gameplay, starting after the first actual admission. The clock includes intermissions. Waves begin at five actors, grow by two to eighteen, and have a twenty-wave recipe limit.

Finite recipes contain two or three waves, generally starting with five to eight foes. Every wave has a veteran; final waves can have an elite from geographic level three, and later waves add another veteran. Cursed chests place an elite leader every third wave when eligible. Existing enemy archetypes supply distinct themed rosters.

There is **no total, ambient, camp, event, dungeon, concurrent-rank or per-archetype actor cap**. Sixteen initial roamers and travel/cooldown-driven packs remain pacing rules. Admission still requires collision-safe, non-sanctuary positions fully outside padded camera coverage. Event members admit independently: one blocked lane cannot stall every other guardian. A bounded search checks all four nearby viewport edges and shallow fallback lanes, then favors short, fully connected walking routes to the player. Routes check the whole guardian body, including tree/rock clearance and sanctuary exclusion; a clear sight ray alone cannot admit a wave. Admission and pursuit share cached obstacle detours. Rounded targets inside trees use reachable neighboring anchors, and large guardians can approach players standing close beside terrain. Newly blocked sight makes ranged guardians reposition instead of maintaining firing distance behind cover. These rules apply to every wave recipe, including cursed chests, guardians, defense and seal events. Existing admitted survivors retain exact positions and source records; unavailable approaches retry without inventing kills, skipping members or teleporting survivors. All guardians start alerted and track the player inside the trial area; attack range and sight checks remain intact.

One trial is active per character. Walking more than 700 world units (about 22 m) from the event pauses finite trials and clears the active slot. The fixed distance is independent of camera zoom. Their progress, wounds, deaths and admitted positions are preserved; return and press E to resume. Visible survivors remain in play, and only hidden survivors park. Other events can be started while a trial is paused. Death, town travel and dungeon entry use the same interruption rules. Timed challenges bank completed waves on expiry, death, leaving the area, town travel or dungeon entry. Surviving enemies keep their source stats and rewards; ending an event does not kill or delete them. Location transitions bank the result in their durable checkpoint. Menus and closed sessions pause game time; reloading resumes the saved clock.

## Rewards and chest presentation

For cursed chests with `W` cleared waves, equipment count is `min(10, floor(W / 2) + (W > 0 ? 1 : 0))`. Gold is a seeded integer between `10W` and `15W`, multiplied by `1 + 0.1 × (siteLevel − 1)`. Every completed wave increases gold; item thresholds add larger rewards. As with every trial reward, the chest opens automatically while the living player is nearby. Equipment always delivers into the newest-1,024 ground queue, replacing the oldest drops when full. Pending gold delivers automatically as pile capacity becomes available; no second interaction is required.

Other new trial rewards contain two veteran-weight item rolls and 20–35 base gold. Trials use item level `siteLevel + 1`, bounded by the existing level ceiling, and a small completion XP bonus. Geographic level-gap adjustments and Journey rewards remain shared. Rarity is not guaranteed; difficult-event material weighting uses the ordinary item generator. Guardians also drop their normal rank/source rewards.

`chest-art.ts` supplies shared anticipation, hinged lid motion, light burst and dispersing particles for surface and dungeon chests. `treasure-flight.ts` plans collision-checked landing points and staggered arcs. Ground items and coins own saved flight metadata; pickup waits for landing. Presentation never creates or grants loot. Reduced motion suppresses flight animation without changing rewards or pickup timing.

`poi-command.ts` persists the entire reward/choice change before publishing it. Delivery bits belong to each item and the gold component, including large cursed bundles. Save failure, full ground capacity and reload cannot reroll or duplicate rewards. E starts the event (and remains available for authored seal objectives). Completing waves, defense, seals or a timed challenge automatically commits the reward and opens the chest without an opening channel or second E press. Ordinary caches, strongboxes, cargo claims and chest-based event interactions commit immediately on E, without an opening timer. Beacon and standing-stone ritual channels remain. The chest lid animation and loot flights play after the durable claim; timed combat challenges retain their wave clock. Completed trial rewards no longer show an interaction prompt. Claimed and partially delivered chests stay open, including when XP has committed but gold-pile capacity temporarily blocks the remaining coins. Nearby pending rewards are checked every 250 ms; records waiting only for gold-pile capacity do not trigger empty saves, and a save failure backs off for 30 seconds before retrying. Reload preserves exact delivery bits and never repeats XP.

## Blessings and retained state

Standing stones offer two biome-weighted choices: Haste (+15% attack/cast speed), Wellspring (20 points of mana-cost reduction), Bulwark (+40% armor), or Fleet (+15 points of movement speed). Normal derived-stat caps apply. One blessing lasts ninety seconds after claiming, pauses in town/menus and disappears on death.

Generated geometry remains immutable. `EventState` retains one trial, casualty records, score, seal anchors, partial deliveries and beacon projections. Older full claims compact into exact IDs; no lifetime interaction quota. Finite payload, presentation and ground-drop bounds remain. Generation **7** changes geography and event recipes and requires fresh test characters; no migration is supplied.

Completed combat sites retain a visual aftermath without changing their generated geometry or collision. Cleared camps keep their solid tents and props but show an extinguished fire and worn canvas before the strongbox is claimed. A completed Corrupted Grove keeps its solid roots while their corruption light becomes inert and small ground sprouts appear. Ruined Chapels lose their profane stone and lantern glow around a quiet ward, Beast Dens retain broken empty nests and scattered litter, and Graveyards extinguish their vigil lamps while sparse flowers mark the settled ground. Cursed coffers shed their binding chains, Quarry crystals become cracked and inert, liberated Hamlets gain warm windows and fresh growth, and cleared Crossings visibly mark an open lane through their battered barricades. Recovered Caravans extinguish their abandoned fire, secured Watchtowers project calm beacon rings, and bound Standing Stones gain a second ring of ritual motes. These consequences are derived from the existing camp ledger and event receipts, including compacted claims; they add no save fields, rewards or regeneration timer.

Active trials use a compact panel on the left with the shared HUD blue-steel surface, silver frame, brass countdown and inset jade progress rail. Square corner fittings match the window metalwork. Static chrome uses the shared native-density UI cache; text and progress remain live. Timed trials drain the bar with remaining time; finite trials fill it with completed waves. The countdown sits at the top right beside the event name. Cursed chests show Waves Cleared: x; other trials show Wave x/total. Both use Enemies Left: x for surviving current-wave members, with hold/seal objectives where relevant. Pending arrivals count as enemies left; completed-wave scoring for cursed rewards remains unchanged. Ordinary active-trial prompts above containers are suppressed; ready seal interactions retain their binding. Blessing text sits below the panel. Presentation reads saved trial progress and draws at native resolution after world post-processing; it owns no gameplay or rewards.

The card expands from its left edge at full height over 0.36 seconds, then fades its contents in over 0.24 seconds. Ending the trial reverses the sequence: contents fade out, then the frame contracts. Renderer-owned presentation retains the last projection during exit and reverses smoothly if visibility changes mid-transition. Gameplay clocks and rewards never wait for the animation. Pausing freezes the transition; reduced motion shows/hides instantly, and renderer resets discard retained cards.

Local review: `/events.html`. All thirteen event entries support **In progress**. A recipe selector exposes every authored variant; Play/Pause, scrubbing, speed and Restart use disposable state. Timed chests and beacon channels use their actual duration. Finite trials stage casualties and hold/seal objectives over twelve preview seconds per wave, explicitly a presentation timeline rather than a gameplay deadline. Strongboxes, caravans and reliquaries explain their instant interactions without creating a fake trial. Completed chest previews replay sample rewards; beacon and blessing previews show the claimed ritual. Trial previews also offer **Replay entrance**, **Replay exit**, an independent animation scrubber and 1×/0.5×/0.25× motion speeds. Replays freeze event time and use the runtime card presentation; reaching the event timeline's end previews the exit before the reward-opening study. Hidden tabs suspend time; reduced motion starts paused and skips card motion. No combat, exploration changes or playable saves are involved. `?view=ruinedChapel&state=progress` opens a progress preview directly.
