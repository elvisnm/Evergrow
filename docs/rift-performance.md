# Rift crowd performance

Measured September 14, 2026 on the development machine. These are CPU timings, not a guaranteed gameplay frame rate.

## Reproduce

```sh
node --experimental-strip-types game/scripts/benchmark-rift-crowds.ts
node --experimental-strip-types game/scripts/benchmark-rift-crowds.ts --density
node --cpu-prof --experimental-strip-types game/scripts/benchmark-rift-crowds.ts --profile
```

The benchmark uses the actual seed-7342 open-world rift, level-30 roster, simulation and AI. It engages the nearest 128, 256 or 512 actors at the first pack, keeps a stationary player alive, and samples 360 fixed ticks after 60 warmup ticks. No player saves or browser gameplay are involved. The density variant uses a Legendary Teeming key (+65%); its layout/composition differs, so it is additional coverage, not a paired baseline.

## Results

Median simulation CPU per 60 Hz frame (two 120 Hz ticks):

| Active enemies | Before | After |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| 128 | 2.07 ms | 0.39 ms |
| 256 | 7.26 ms | 1.14 ms |
| 512 | 29.76 ms | 8.23 ms |

At 512 actors this removes roughly 72% of the simulation cost. The +65% density fixture measured 5.09 ms at 512 actors. Differences between fixtures reflect archetypes, obstacles and positioning.

The initial CPU profile concentrated in repeated landscape collision queries, movement/navigation, and all-enemy separation scans. Changes:

- Query neighboring spatial cells for separation, retaining original iteration order and immediate position updates. No enemy cap, reduced tick rate or delayed attacks.
- Batch walking/visibility rays: query collision regions once, then test the nearest existing discrete sample per circular obstacle. Buildings, authored sites and overridden collision implementations use the original path.
- Skip per-sample sanctuary queries when a segment cannot reach a settlement; rifts use the same discrete samples against their circular arrival sanctuary.

A 100-seed Legendary Teeming generation audit produced 3,542–3,799 non-guardian monsters; all 46 packs reached at least 64 members. Slowest layout generation was 76 ms on the development machine, outside combat ticks.

Regression coverage compares accelerated and original queries across ordinary/rift worlds and custom walls, checks spatial neighbors after cell crossings, and validates density placement at all five key rarities.

## Rendering and limits

The rift map tool's **Profile rendering** action repeats the actual renderer and post-processing on a frozen pack at 1100×900 for 150 frames, discarding 30 warmup frames. It displays median/p95 CPU and stores stage timings on the result element. No AI ticks or save access occur.

The frozen seed-7342 Verdant scene staged 127 enemies and measured **4.5 ms median / 5.1 ms p95** render CPU in the in-app browser at 1100×900. The actor/prop pass accounted for 2.5 ms median, scenery 0.6 ms, lighting 0.6 ms and post-processing 0.1 ms (nested stage timings are not additive). This check did not reveal a rendering bottleneck comparable to the original 29.8 ms simulation cost.

Headless timings exclude drawing, GPU scheduling, effects from a long fight, save serialization and device thermal limits. Static render timings exclude moving combat/effect creation. Both are useful diagnostics; sustained gameplay FPS still needs the user's playtest.

## Silhouette glow follow-up

After replacing the rejected floating trait symbols with blue/gold silhouette outlines, the same frozen seed-7342 scene measured **5.4 ms median / 6.0 ms p95** render CPU. The outline paints each ranked character once into a small reusable surface sized for its body and weapons, then composites a tinted rim and soft glow. An initial oversized scratch surface caused GPU submission stalls and was replaced before completing the pass. Gameplay simulation and its measured crowd optimizations are unchanged.

Guardian-arrival/reward regressions bring the full suite to **1,480 passing tests**; type checks and the production build passed. The arrival warning and final silhouette treatment were inspected using save-free static scenes.
