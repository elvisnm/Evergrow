# World generation 9

Local settlement rework · generation 10 (2026-09-09): three settlement tiers, outdoor starting refuges without houses, families, gambling and personal storage. Generation-9 characters upgrade on Continue, preserving progression and exploration. The original save is retained until the upgrade commits. See [Settlements](settlements.md). Earlier generation/layout statements below describe the prior checkpoint.
Local addition: [wilderness boss lairs](wilderness-bosses.md) add three bosses, Elite/Veteran retinues and automatic Rare-or-better hoards through a separate placement layer. Existing landmark identities and save formats remain unchanged.

The local generation pass replaces the north–south settlement corridor and repeated cross-roads. Each new character receives a random unsigned 32-bit world seed. Character creation shows an editable **World seed** field and a **Randomize** button; saved-character selection keeps the chosen seed visible. Continuing reconstructs that character’s world before restoring its position, encounters and explored chart. Generation 9 adds Steppe and Sunscar and applies clustered vegetation, open glades and geological prop bands everywhere. Fresh test characters are required. The default review seed remains **7319**. `/atlas.html?seed=7319&view=extended` also accepts any unsigned 32-bit seed for save-free comparisons. Suggested comparisons are **18427** and **90210**. These are generated worlds, not painted map concepts.

## Settlements and routes

`world-geography.ts` owns deterministic two-dimensional settlement sites. An 11,000-unit lattice is rotated by the seed and jittered by up to 22% per axis. Each site chooses the most habitable dry location from three candidates (up to eight if all three intersect water) using the shared biome weights: forest and autumn ground are favored over marsh, burnt ground and highlands. Neighboring centers remain at least 6,160 units apart. The home settlement is generated with the same seeded names, building counts and town/city choice as other settlements. Home-relative coordinates place its center at `(0, -1150)` and the player at `(0, 0)`, on the clear southern approach. Every seed independently chooses one of the nine home biomes with equal weight; terrain suitability does not exclude harsher climates from starting worlds. Approximately one in five settlements, including possible homes, is a larger city; the others retain the furnished town layouts and services.

The lattice is an invisible generation partition, not a road grid. Every settlement selects a lower-distance neighboring site as its parent, guaranteeing a connected inward route to the home settlement. Occasional diagonal links add alternate loops. Roads no longer extend infinitely east/west or repeat on a fixed interval. Dead ends at the displayed chart edge continue into unknown terrain.

`road-shape.ts` builds shared curved polylines between actual settlements. Two candidate bends are compared against the climate field to prefer gentler terrain. North/south town approaches preserve the existing full-width central street, doors, furniture and sanctuary. Terrain material, map strokes, prop/site clearance, roadside shrines and reliquaries consume the same seeded geometry. This is bounded candidate routing, not a river simulation or erosion model. Generation 6 adds sparse descending river networks and irregular receiving lakes through the independent hydrology layer. Roads cross as shallow fords. Physical ridgelines, bridges and branching hamlet trails remain later work. See [living water](living-water.md).

Seeded memoization is bounded: 512 place records, 512 roads, 512 local segment buckets, 512 travel costs, and 2,048 roadside anchors. World instances also retain at most 128 coarse settlement lookup cells so terrain pixels do not repeat site enumeration. Eviction only affects recomputation. Queries validate extents and cap enumeration; there is no global graph build. Numeric settlement identities encode both cell coordinates and are shared with town portals.

## Larger climates

The nine-biome field and shared grove/rock/corridor distribution are described in [natural landscapes](natural-landscapes.md). The main game, terrain worker, biome scenes and atlas use the same generator.


The climate-region spacing increases from 2,400 to **6,400 units**. Adjacent cells can share climates, giving larger irregular interiors. Broader coordinate warps preserve uneven boundaries and smooth transitions. A softly blended home-climate region covers the settlement and southern arrival. Its core extends 1,100 units from that corridor and blends into neighboring climates by 2,600. Rivers and lakes share a continuous dry-bank exclusion around home, including city footprints. Actual ground, trees, atmosphere, loot biases and the map share the same climate field.

## Regional landmarks

Twelve landmark families occupy a 1,400-unit seeded lattice, with twelve scored candidates, regional/biome kind weights, road-adjacent caravans/hamlets/crossings and quieter inland sites. Placement checks centers and perimeter samples against water and settlements. Approaches face the nearest road segment and share their orientation with decor, camp members and ground tracks; chapels retain a front-facing aisle to match their upright architecture. All six new POIs and cursed chests participate in map discovery and Journeys. See [wilderness places](wilderness-and-encounters.md).

## Bounded regional danger

The existing named, warped districts now own ordinary level ranges rather than fixed levels. The home district is 1–12; road travel and remoteness lead through overlapping 4–18, 7–22, 12–28 and 18–35 ranges, with tougher wilderness pockets. District shapes, terrain, towns and roads remain generation 9. New encounters snapshot the player within those bounds; existing encounters retain their levels. See [regional scaling](region-scaling.md) for rank offsets, rewards, guidance and save compatibility.

## Map and reviews

The actual runtime large map now shows revealed regional boundaries, names and level ranges. Orange `!` labels indicate hazardous districts. Region labels avoid town names and one another; overlapping minor POIs are suppressed before hover testing. Zooming reveals more landmarks. Boundary strokes and label anchors respect discovery, including hidden holes. The minimap retains its compact terrain treatment and does not receive regional labels.

The extended atlas stages a roughly 40,000-unit-wide surveyed disk through memory-only Exploration. It uses no simulation ticks, gameplay input or character saves. Native Canvas PNG exports use the real WorldMap renderer and are explicitly identified as CPU renders. Local navigation and PNG export remain available in the in-app browser.

## Prototype reset and verification

Generation version is **9**. The nine-biome field, clustered props and climate-aware water/settlement placement change geography. Older-generation characters remain stored, but cannot be loaded into this generation. Create a fresh character; no migration or automatic deletion is introduced. Exploration namespaces remain generation-specific.

Code tests cover minimum settlement separation, two-dimensional dispersion, connectivity to the start, shared walkable road geometry, deterministic generation, interiors and entrances, seeded regional danger and hazards, spawn snapshots, same-level portal landings, conservative map fog and label placement. Gameplay pacing and combat feel remain the user's playtest responsibility.


## Shared landscape queries and rifts (September 14, 2026)

`world-landscape.ts` owns the existing DOM-free terrain, hydrology, prop generation, collision and navigation queries. `world.ts` extends it with cached canvas tiles; the ordinary overworld keeps the same default behavior and coordinates. Rifts use the wilderness-only option, disabling settlements/landmarks/shrines while retaining the actual natural landscape. The terrain worker receives that option explicitly. There is no parallel rift terrain generator; rift generation only places its roster and activity markers onto this landscape. See [rifts](rifts.md).

Connected rift encounters (approved for publication September 14): an explicit `riftTerrain` profile applies `rift-shape.ts` clearings, broad reconnecting trails and biome ridges through `WorldLandscape`. Water, prop collision, maps and worker-rendered terrain use this same profile. Ordinary worlds and saved open-layout rifts retain their preceding landscape. See the connected encounters section in [Rifts](rifts.md).
