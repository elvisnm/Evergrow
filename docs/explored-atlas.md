# Explored atlas review

The local `/atlas.html` page shows the actual interactive world map after extensive staged exploration. It uses `World`, `Exploration` and `WorldMap` directly. It does not advance gameplay, create a character, use localStorage or modify the player's saved chart.

Three views are available:

- `/atlas.html?seed=7319`
- `/atlas.html?seed=18427`
- `/atlas.html?seed=90210`

Each seed uses the real seven-biome terrain, settlements and wilderness places. The staged discovery uses overlapping travelled circles across a roughly 20,000-unit region, with an irregular frontier, unexplored bays and narrow excursions. Every charted pixel and POI passes through the normal exploration API; the review does not paint undiscovered terrain. All seven biomes are present in the revealed portion of each sample. Camp markers retain their initial state because no enemies have been defeated.

The seed tabs change the local review. The map retains normal panning, zooming and POI hover. **Export chart PNG** saves the current chart canvas with its current framing. The default framing comes from `WorldMap.fitBounds`, which changes only the map camera. The page can be captured in the Codex in-app browser without touching the playable game.

## Runtime improvements

Hold Tab from gameplay for a simplified exploration overlay: no frame, header, footer, coordinate grid or danger labels; terrain is drawn at 58% opacity, with a bright player marker and no on-map toolbar. The world keeps running with normal gameplay controls. The chart always centers on the player and mouse input passes through to the game. Release Tab to close. M (including from a Tab glance), the minimap button and Journey Show on Map open the full paused map. See [controls](controls.md).

The full map's upper-right compass is a simple procedural Canvas rose with four faceted points and cardinal lettering, without a surrounding frame, bearing ticks or diagonal points. North is highlighted in gold and stays aligned with the north-up chart. The map-compass-art.ts module owns this native-resolution ornament; no image asset or world state is involved.

The full map now zooms out to **0.025**, allowing a broad region to fit on screen. A scale rail gives the overview a readable distance reference. Native biome labels are placed only on revealed, predominantly matching terrain; they avoid settlement markers and reserve space from minor POIs. Labels are a cartographic aid, not discovery or simulation state.

Overview POIs use deterministic priority and spacing: settlements and camps remain readable, while overlapping shop markers return at closer zoom. Hover queries the exact list that is drawn, so a hidden shop or obscured landmark cannot intercept a visible marker. At closer zoom, detailed building footprints remain available. The minimap uses a 0.05 scale (60% more distance across than 0.08) while retaining detailed terrain sampling. Walking reveals terrain and nearby POIs within 600 world units, up from 260; its discovery ring shares the same radius. Existing explored charts are preserved.

The full atlas uses its own 128 × 128 terrain tiles; the minimap retains its original 32 × 32 tiles, color sampler and drawing path. Cache keys distinguish the two surfaces. Large-map ground colors come from the game's actual ground materials, water, soil and paving, with a brighter chart exposure. Each normal tile takes 64 × 64 world samples; extended overview tiles use at most 128 × 128. Sampling aligns with the 48-unit discovery cells, so a coarse color never bridges a known/unknown cell boundary.

`map-terrain-art.ts` adds woodland canopies, recognizable conifers, bare branches and rock silhouettes at actual generated prop anchors. Crown extents use the shared prop registry; a padded query includes neighboring crowns crossing tile borders. Overview symbols have reduced contrast, and prop queries stop above 3,072-unit tiles. Roads follow the exact shared centerlines, with brighter atlas ink. All detail is flattened into the terrain tile before the common exploration mask is applied. Town roofs retain actual building footprints, distinct warm/slate materials, ridge lines and roof courses. Buildings require complete discovery coverage before drawing; the large-map coordinate grid is quieter.

The chart retains its 768-, 1,536- and 3,072-unit coverage levels, further powers of two for unusually large views, 256 visible-tile limit and shared 384-entry cache. Each atlas entry stores two 128 × 128 canvases (base and masked), about 48 MiB for 384 atlas entries before browser/GPU overhead. Roads do not add retained canvases to atlas tiles. Fog revisions rebuild only the revealed surface, reusing its terrain and prop art. At overview scales where a pixel covers multiple discovery cells, every covered cell must be known.

`/atlas.html?view=local` opens a closer, save-free town-and-woodland study. The default review remains the broad multi-biome overview. Both use the same full-map renderer as the runtime game.

`atlas-review-data.ts` owns only the sample travel coverage. `map-view.ts` owns bounded fit/zoom math. `world-map.ts` owns terrain presentation, masks, biome labels, visible marker selection and map controls. Terrain color and biome generation remain world-owned.

## Verification

Map tests cover broad framing, zoom-anchor preservation, working-set/cache bounds, conservative coarse fog, updates in all covered exploration chunks, deterministic POI selection, matching hover targets, revealed-only biome labels, isolation of minimap/atlas caches, and fine-grained masking of atlas detail (including unknown holes inside explored terrain). Tests and static review do not replace the user's gameplay feedback.

The images in `docs/captures/2026-09-05/biome-atlas/` are **direct CPU exports of the actual map renderer**, not browser screenshots. The Mac was locked and the in-app browser could not be controlled during this review. A disposable `/tmp` Node canvas package supplied the Canvas API; the export invoked the real `WorldMap` drawing methods with real world data, the shared exploration staging, and the bundled Pixelify Sans font. It added no project dependency, advanced no gameplay and accessed no exploration save. The three seed views were inspected at 0.05 zoom; the additional wide view was inspected at 0.025.

## Geography and danger study

`/atlas.html?seed=7319&view=extended&levels=1` stages a roughly 40,000-unit-wide surveyed disk in memory. Seed tabs compare 7319, 18427 and 90210; arbitrary signed 32-bit seed parameters are also supported. These previews use actual generated roads, terrain, settlements and regional danger without touching gameplay saves.

Generation 5 spreads settlements across both dimensions, enlarges the climate field, and connects towns with curved routes. Named, irregular danger districts replace the old radial bands. The full in-game map and this review both show revealed boundaries, names and levels, with orange `!` labels for more dangerous wilderness pockets. Regions avoid towns and suppress overlapping minor POIs before hover testing. Towns remain sanctuaries. See [world generation](world-generation.md) for current geography, tuning, query bounds and the authorized test-progress reset.

## Interaction performance

The full map populates its footer before measuring the viewport on each chart draw. Canvas resolution, map projection and the arrival ping therefore share the same dimensions on first opening and when status text wraps.

**Center on character** (or Home while the chart is focused) preserves zoom and eases back to the player over roughly 0.4–0.85 seconds, depending on the screen distance. Two brief gold rings mark arrival, including when already centered. Dragging, touch gestures, zooming, keyboard panning, reframing or closing cancel the effect immediately. Operating-system reduced motion uses immediate centering and a stationary fading ring. The arrival highlight is a screen-space overlay and does not regenerate terrain.

Journey **Show on map** uses the same easing and arrival highlight at the objective. The map first opens on the player with a 450 ms hold, then pans to the public objective marker over roughly 0.6–1.36 seconds at the current zoom; undiscovered objectives retain their coarse search-area position.

Map input is coalesced into display frames, ordinary hover does not repaint terrain, and new atlas detail builds progressively within a cooperative generation budget. A complete low-resolution preview covers revealed terrain immediately and finished tiles crossfade into it over 240 ms (instant with reduced motion). Fine fog masks use row-run copies; district contours are cached in world-aligned tiles and rechecked against current discovery. See [panel performance](panel-performance.md) for budgets, verification and measured limits.

Tab-map marker tooltips appear automatically whenever hovered, including during combat, without consuming mouse input. On the full paused map, general area information appears in a fixed upper-left glass panel: district name, biome, level range (or Sanctuary) and hovered world coordinates. It updates only over discovered terrain, including beneath discovered icons, and hides over unknown terrain, outside the chart, during dragging/recentering and when the map closes. POI and Journey icon details still follow the cursor and remain clamped inside the chart. Both displays pass pointer input through to the map; the held-Tab overlay retains only icon tooltips.

While holding Tab, the mouse wheel zooms the chart around the player; clicks continue to reach gameplay.

While the Tab overlay is held, Journey discovery and arrival progress continue, and the configured loot-reveal key remains usable. The dungeon player marker stays fully opaque above the translucent floor.

## Map legend — local September 15, 2026

The full map has a Legend side panel using the same procedural icon art as the chart. The top Legend button toggles the panel and shows a brass border, underline and soft glow while open; there is no separate close button inside the sidebar. Categories separate NPCs/services, towns/travel, encounters/dungeons, shrines/landmarks, character/Journey markers, dungeon interiors and nearby enemies. Each row explains the icon. Category headers collapse independently of visibility; individual, category and Show all checkboxes support mixed selections. Dungeon maps expose the relevant navigation, dungeon and enemy categories. Journey filters also hide their offscreen direction arrows; ranked enemy dots have their own entries.

NPC rows represent service types, with one **Ping nearest** button each. The target is the closest visited, discovered service of that type measured from the character, independent of camera position and current filters. Unvisited sightings do not qualify; unavailable buttons are disabled. Arrival uses the existing player-centering pan and two gold rings, preserving zoom. The target temporarily bypasses hidden filters, overview service suppression and icon overlap so the arrival remains readable, then returns to normal visibility. Pings never reveal terrain, create discoveries, move the character or modify saves.

Visibility is shared by the current game's world, dungeon, held-Tab, minimap and Thor projection surfaces. It lasts for that game session, including character changes, and resets when the app/page restarts. Collapsed categories and panel visibility stay local to their map panel. No save schema change or progress reset.

Desktop uses a 334px side panel, leaving the chart in its own measured viewport. At widths up to 900px or heights up to 560px, the legend starts closed and opens as a scrollable drawer. Ping nearest closes that compact drawer before centering, so its arrival remains visible. Native checkboxes and buttons support keyboard/controller navigation; closing the drawer returns any focus inside it to the Legend toggle before hiding it. Touch actions have larger targets. The held-Tab overlay remains free of legend chrome. The dungeon canvas now follows the available CSS dimensions at native display density, keeping hover, drag and pinch coordinates aligned when the side panel opens. Wheel, pinch and zoom buttons share limits that keep the fitted dungeon overview reachable on compact screens; resizing cannot turn a zoom-out action into zoom-in.

The existing atlas study includes the runtime Legend control and remains save-free. Browser and physical Android visual acceptance are still user-tested.
