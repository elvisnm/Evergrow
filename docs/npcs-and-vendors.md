# NPCs, vendors and item improvement

Local settlement rework · generation 10 (2026-09-09): three settlement tiers, outdoor starting refuges without houses, families, gambling and personal storage. Fresh local characters required; old slots remain stored. See [Settlements](settlements.md). Earlier generation/layout statements below describe the prior checkpoint.
Local regional scaling, 2026-09-08: Shop stock and relevel services now scale within the town region’s ordinary range. Stock uses the three-level epoch floor so unsold items do not reroll within an epoch; relevel quotes use the current bounded player level. See [regional scaling](region-scaling.md).

New stock rolls the shared [equipment material pools](item-materials.md). Material persists through services and uses full trade-value multipliers but gentler service premiums (silver 1.2×, gold 1.5×, crystal 2×); services cannot change an item's material.


Implemented service contract · 2026-09-05. Blacksmith, jeweler and enchanter are available in town. Prices, stock weights and enhancement strength are initial playtest tuning. Static captures live in [town services](captures/2026-09-05/town-services/README.md). Save payload version 2 adds explicit item recipes and commerce state; older slots remain stored but require a new character, with no migration.

## Town services

| NPC | Services | Stock |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Blacksmith | Buy equipment, sell any unequipped item, enhance equipment to +10 | 12 weapons, shields and armor pieces |
| Jeweler | Buy jewelry and caster foci, sell any unequipped item | 8 pieces: 4 rings, 2 amulets, 1 grimoire and 1 orb |
| Enchanter | Raise rarity, reroll one affix, reroll all affixes, raise item level | No equipment shop |

Every town supplies all three services. Use the existing forge for the blacksmith, merchant building for the jeweler, and a work area in the chapel for the enchanter. Preserve doors, streets and footprints. Give each service a distinct discovered-map icon and concise role label; replace redundant shop markers rather than overlapping them.

NPC identities derive from world/building ID and role. Procedural names, clothing and accessories remain stable. Start with stationary shopkeepers, relaxed idle animation and a short working gesture: hammer, gemstone inspection or floating rune. Their workstations, lighting and silhouettes distinguish them without oversized labels. Furniture must leave a reachable interaction spot.

Click a nearby NPC or press **E** on the focused NPC to open its service. Initial interaction distance: 70 world units from the designated interaction spot, with an unobstructed approach. Focus requires proximity; clicks through a wall cannot trade. NPC interaction consumes the input instead of attacking. Register the service panel with `PanelCoordinator`: opening clears held actions and pauses combat; Escape closes it and restores gameplay focus. No dialogue tree or daily schedule in this first version.

## Shop experience

Reuse the compact shared window, item cells, rarity treatment, animated tooltips and complete equipment comparisons. Every service shows the same 12-column, six-row spatial bag as the character window, with item footprints, saved positions and four reserved charm rows. Shop stock, buyback and equipped gear use compact selectors; they do not rearrange the carried bag. Prices and slot labels sit below the cells. All merchants share the same header with their role, wallet and close control. No subtitle or flavor paragraph.

Shop layout: stock on the left, the player's spatial bag on the right. Shops, buyback, gambling, storage and upgrade services inspect item stats through hover/focus tooltips; they never pin a duplicate item-stat card into the window. Selected names and prices stay in the footer. Gambling reveals a compact item icon/name with the same tooltip. Upgrade panels retain affix selection, costs, odds and a concise enhancement/rarity/level outcome, without full affix lists or character-stat tables. Item selection no longer scrolls the grid toward a details panel. Hover shows the ordinary item tooltip, price and effective equip changes. Selecting a shop item exposes one clear **Buy · 285 gold** action. Buying puts it in the bag; it never equips automatically. Shift-click may buy/sell directly, using exactly the same validated command. Ordinary inventory retains hover-only inspection; the service selection exists only to identify the transaction target.

Blacksmith and enchanter show a separate **Equipped** section above the bag. Click worn gear to improve it in place; clicking it from the blacksmith shop opens Enhance. Empty bags preserve their visible grid. Equipment never needs to be moved into the bag for enhancement or enchanting, except when releveling would exceed the wearer’s level requirement.

Selling transfers the exact item and credits gold. Equipped items must first be unequipped. Keep a shared **Buyback** list of the last 12 sales per character, available at every blacksmith, jeweler, enchanter and gambler, at the original sale price. Buyback preserves the item, its enhancement and its reroll history. Display that limit; the thirteenth sale retires the oldest entry. **Sell** opens the same dedicated multi-select view at all four merchants, including the gambler and enchanter. It mirrors the carried spatial inventory and includes the shared rarity selectors, receipt and gold animation. Click bag items to toggle them, or use Common / Magic / Rare / Epic / Legendary chips to select or deselect an entire rarity. The receipt lists exact items, count and total gold; its Sell button commits the selection once. Clear removes the selection. Equipped items never enter this view. Batches over 12 explicitly note the buyback limit before payment.

Blacksmith stock guarantees a sword, bow, staff, wand and shield, with the other seven entries covering armor and randomly selected equipment. All supported weapon profiles can appear. Jewelry stock is generated equipment with fully visible stats, not a blind purchase.

Current stock rarity weights:

| Stock | Common | Magic | Rare | Epic | Legendary |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Blacksmith | 55% | 35% | 9% | 1% | 0% |
| Jeweler | 0% | 60% | 35% | 4.8% | 0.2% |

These are separate from monster loot tables. Stock starts at +0 and uses the NPC's geographic zone level, not player level. The jeweler's price premium makes excellent rolls an expensive opportunity.

Stock refreshes at character levels **4, 7, 10, …**, globally for that character. The restock epoch is `floor((level - 1) / 3)`. Returning, reopening, waiting, reloading or unloading a town never refreshes stock. Purchased cells remain sold until the next epoch. Buyback survives restocking. Show only a small functional restock hint when needed. No paid refresh in v1.

## Three independent item axes

| Axis | Meaning | What changes it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Item level | Geographic power budget and required level | Enchanter relevel |
| Rarity | Common → Magic → Rare → Epic → Legendary; affix count and rarity budget | Enchanter rarity upgrade |
| Enhancement | Permanent +0 through +10 improvement | Blacksmith |

Use **Enhance** for the blacksmith service so it is not confused with rarity. The current blue tier is named **Magic**, not Uncommon. Legendary currently means the highest ordinary rarity; this spec does not invent unique powers.

All improvements preserve the item's instance ID, base/profile, visual seed and name. Append `+N` to the displayed name when enhanced. Changing rarity updates its presentation. Improving an item does not heal the character or refill mana; recompute projections through the existing character command/stat boundary.

### Blacksmith enhancement

Every equippable item, including jewelry and starter gear, can be enhanced one step at a time, up to **+10**. Success is guaranteed. No destruction, downgrade or additional materials.

Initial effect: `enhancementMultiplier = 1 + 0.05 × enhancement`. Thus +5 gives ×1.25 and +10 gives ×1.50 to weapon base damage, armor, stat-bearing implicits and all affix values. Shield base block chance and blocked-damage reduction also receive this multiplier, subject to existing final character caps. Weapon family, handedness, attack geometry, base cadence and range stay intrinsic to the profile; attack/cast-speed affixes do improve.

Derive from the unenhanced recipe, then apply enhancement and round once using the stat's existing precision. Never multiply an already enhanced or rounded item. Percentage budgets still use the existing bounded growth curves, and final character caps remain authoritative. The character's detailed stats and item-comparison tooltips expose effective bonuses and caps.

UI: a legible +N badge separate from rarity, restrained metal highlights on enhanced borders, more intricate trim at +5 and +10. A brief forge pulse traces the item icon when the transaction succeeds. The tooltip shows `Enhancement +4 / 10` while the workbench shows the next-step comparison. Avoid continuous glitter on every bag cell; reduced motion uses static details. Ground labels and equipment slots use the same +N treatment.

### Enchanter: raise rarity

Raise exactly one tier per purchase, guaranteed. Keep existing affix identities and normalized roll quality, recalculate them under the new rarity budget, and add the new affix slot. Counts remain **0 / 1 / 2 / 3 / 4**. The added affix is random and drawn without duplicating an existing stat. Enhancement stays intact. Legendary disables this action.

Before payment show the guaranteed base/existing-affix changes, new affix count, price and eligible new-affix pool. Do not pretend the random added affix is known before purchase.

### Enchanter: reroll affixes

- **Reroll one:** choose one affix row. Replace its type and roll; preserve every other affix. Exclude other occupied stats and, when alternatives exist, the replaced stat. This targeted control costs three times the initial full reroll.
- **Reroll all:** replace all affix types and rolls, keeping the rarity's affix count. Draw distinct stats from the item's eligible pool; previous types may return.

Both preserve implicits, level, rarity, enhancement and appearance. Common items have no affixes, so both actions are disabled. Outcomes replace the previous values; they can be worse. Show the eligible outcomes and a concise replacement warning beside the paid action, not a second modal every time.

Maintain separate targeted/full reroll counters per item; repeated use raises that service's price. They persist through selling, buying back, releveling and rarity upgrades. Randomness advances only for a successfully committed operation. There is no free outcome preview or reload-based reroll.

### Enchanter: raise item level

Raise directly to the **current NPC zone level**, queried through the shared geographic progression rules. It is not the player's level or highest visited area. Capture the target in the quote and validate it at execution. Equal/higher-level items cannot be downgraded or charged.

Keep affix types and their normalized roll quality. Re-evaluate base stats and affixes at the target level using the existing flat and percentage growth functions, then reapply rarity and enhancement. No extra affixes, fresh random rolls or lost +N levels. A good roll stays a good roll within its new budget.

Recalculate the requirement using the current rule `max(1, itemLevel - 2)`. Preview it clearly. If an equipped item would become unusable, require unequipping first; never silently strand it in an invalid equipped state. A bag item may be upgraded beyond the player's level, with the new requirement visible before payment.

## Initial economy

Keep formulas in one headless content/rules module, shared by quotes and execution. They must not depend on UI colors or the summary power score.

Let `B(L) = 30 × (1 + 0.1 × (L - 1))`, rarity factor `R = 1 / 2 / 5 / 12 / 30`, and enhancement investment factor `H = 1 + 0.1 × enhancement`. Round costs up and sale proceeds down to whole gold.

| Operation | Gold price |
| --- | --- |
| Buy equipment | `B(L) × R` |
| Buy jewelry | `2.5 × B(L) × R` |
| Sell | `0.15 × B(L) × R` (also for jewelry) |
| Enhance to step n | `3 × B(L) × R × 1.65^(n - 1)` |
| Raise rarity | `8 × B(L) × targetR × H` |
| Reroll one | `15 × B(L) × R × H × 1.25^targetedCount` |
| Reroll all | `5 × B(L) × R × H × 1.20^fullCount` |
| Relevel from L to Z | `3 × R × H × sum(B(k), k = L + 1 … Z)` |

Compute the relevel sum analytically, not by looping through potentially a million levels. All costs and resulting balances must be finite safe integers. Stop escalating prices at the numeric boundary by disabling the operation; never overflow or silently reduce its price.

Example for a **level-10 Rare +0 item**:

| Action | Gold |
| --- | ---: |
| Buy equipment / jewelry | 285 / 713 |
| Sell | 42 |
| Enhance +0 → +1 | 855 |
| Enhance +9 → +10 | 77,504 |
| Total +0 → +10 at this level/rarity | 195,428 |
| Upgrade to Epic | 5,472 |
| First single / full reroll | 4,275 / 1,425 |
| Relevel 10 → 15 | 4,950 |

This intentionally makes +10 a long-term investment, not an early expectation. Current level-one normal enemies average 3.85 gold per kill before equipment sales; a 30-gold common purchase takes roughly eight normal kills on average. Gold drops and the base shop budget share the same linear level factor, while enhancement steps escalate sharply. Actual affordability must be tuned from the player's sessions.

Enhancing/rerolling does not raise sale proceeds; these are investments, not refundable gold storage. Rarity/relevel changes may raise proceeds, but always less than the service cost. Buyback returns only the original sale price. Verify that no buy/sell/improve sequence creates profit. Improving earlier at a lower level/rarity is intentionally cheaper; the resulting stats at the same final recipe are independent of operation order.

## Implementation contracts

**Item recipe:** separate stable instance identity from procedural seed. Retain explicit base/profile ID, appearance seed, item level, rarity, enhancement, affix definition IDs with normalized roll values, reroll counters and item revision. Starter gear needs explicit recipes too. The current generated weapon ID is an instance ID, so it cannot substitute for its source profile. One derivation path serves drops, shops, improvement previews, saves, icons and combat. Do not add a second stat calculator or infer recipes from rounded affix values.

**Ownership and transactions:** typed buy, sell, sellMany, buyback and improve commands share one planner. Bulk quotes snapshot every bag index, item identity and recipe revision; duplicate, missing, replaced or revised entries reject the entire offer. One validated wallet credit, one commerce revision and one durable checkpoint commit the whole batch. A failure preserves all items and gold. A quote contains vendor ID, stock epoch/revision, item ID/revision, operation, target and price. Revalidate ownership, interaction session, affordability, slot capacity, requirements, limits and quote freshness. Plan the complete change before mutation. Commit wallet, inventory/equipment, stock/buyback and random-operation counter together; duplicate or stale requests change nothing. Improvement controls show the target enhancement, rarity or item level; the same derivation remains authoritative for the resulting equipment and combat stats.

**Persistence:** character-owned vendor state lives separately from frozen town geometry and exploration. Save it in the same checkpoint as the wallet and inventory. Stock is reconstructed from vendor ID, epoch, slot and a stock-only seed; retain purchased-cell masks rather than hundreds of duplicated item recipes. Issued stock IDs include vendor/epoch/slot and use a namespace distinct from enemy drops. Bought/sold/buyback items transfer their identity, never regenerate it.

Keep only the current epoch's purchase masks, plus 12 exact buyback items and transaction revisions. Initial bound: 2,048 visited vendor masks per epoch. Never evict a current mask and accidentally refill its stock. At this prototype limit, previously visited shops remain available; new stock is unavailable until the next restock, while improvement services still work. Measure the worst-case checkpoint against the existing 700,000-character serialized limit and adjust encoding/bounds together before shipping the feature.

Extract shared item validation and enforce unique ownership across bag, equipment, ground drops, buyback and available stock identities. Persist a successful transaction before presenting completion. If storage fails or a stale writer is detected, discard the staged trade, leave gold/items unchanged and show the existing save failure feedback. Random results and their counter commit together. This is local consistency, not anti-cheat against edited browser data.

**Presentation:** emit typed transaction results after commitment. Reuse compact notifications for purchases and improvements. Successful sales show one compact receipt in the service footer, with no duplicate notification. A bounded three-second service overlay reuses the pickup coin renderer and RewardCounter: coins fly from sold bag cells to the vendor wallet, the balance counts up, and the existing gold pickup sound plays once after commitment. Reduced motion keeps a static gain and immediate balance; closing the panel disposes all animation work. No presentation event credits gold or records Chronicle twice. Spending gold must not enter the positive gold/XP reward accumulator. No new notification framework or service locator. Service panels reuse `ItemTooltip`, shared item components and the panel coordinator.

## Implemented delivery and verification

All five delivery areas below are implemented and have static in-app review captures. The code suite passes 507 tests, including transaction failures, recipe derivation, save bounds and NPC reachability. Gameplay/economy acceptance remains with the player.

1. **NPC interaction + blacksmith buy/sell/buyback:** stable placement, shared panel, stock generation, item issuance, complete transactions and persistence together. Test full bag, insufficient gold, duplicate clicks, stale quotes, return/reload/restock, storage failure and character switching.
2. **Recipe-backed +10 enhancement:** one derivation path and before/after UI. Test all item kinds, starter items, both hands, caps, +10 rejection, rounding, resources unchanged and save round-trips. Verify equal final stats for enhancement before/after relevel or rarity changes with equivalent recipes.
3. **Jeweler:** jewelry stock, prices, appearance and existing shop machinery. Test stock composition, independent RNG and no profitable resale loop.
4. **Enchanter:** rarity, targeted/full rerolls and geographic releveling. Test affix uniqueness, preserved rolls/identity/enhancement, counter escalation, random failure atomicity, level requirements and extreme numeric bounds.
5. **Static in-app review:** capture town NPCs, vendor layout and +0/+5/+10 tooltip treatments at normal and narrow widths. Leave gameplay and economy testing to the player. Commit and push each coherent implementation checkpoint.

No quest framework, wandering schedules, reputation, materials, repairs, haggling or unique-item powers are required for this first system.

### Specialist affixes and skill ranks · 2026-09-07

Stock, loot, rarity upgrades and rerolls share the expanded slot pools in [equipment affixes](equipment-affixes.md). Enhancement improves scalable rolls but leaves +skill and +pierce integers unchanged. Releveling retains roll quality and can unlock a higher saved skill-rank quantile at the new item level. Item tooltips expose the resulting bonuses; service controls summarize the target enhancement, rarity or level. Skill-family exclusion allows at most one named skill affix on an item.

## Multi-sell review · local, 2026-09-07

`/services.html?sell` opens an isolated blacksmith sale selection with sample gear. Add `&sound` to hear the coin cue when selling. Transactions affect only the review character; no saves or gameplay ticks are involved. This update awaits the next requested Sites publication.

The shop labels the actual stock level for its three-level refresh bracket (for example, Stock · Lv 7 at character level 8). The improvement tab separately shows the current Services level. Both remain capped by the town region; labels use the same level calculation as generated stock and service quotes.

Local generation 10 now includes tiered stock, material and gambling advantages, premium offers and city affix preferences. See [settlements](settlements.md) for exact weights, prices, validation, identities and local review URLs.


Gambling retains the selected equipment category after each purchase and when returning from Sell or Buyback. Each completed save refreshes the next offer immediately; there is no extra click cooldown or wait for the reveal animation. Choices and the Gamble button stay mounted while the wallet, new item and pack update. Only one transaction runs at a time, and items and gold still commit together after a successful local save. Insufficient gold or pack space disables the next purchase.


## Local post-0.3.0 item protection and upgrade steps

Locked items cannot be sold, including manually or in a bulk quote. Rarity shortcuts omit active charms unless explicitly included; deliberate individual selections can still sell them. See [charm and inventory hardening](charms.md#local-inventory-hardening-after-030).

An enhancement purchase advances to the next +N that changes real item bonuses, skipping rounded-away ranks at no extra cost. If no change exists by +10, it cannot be purchased. Rarity upgrades likewise skip ineffective tiers, using the destination tier's normal upgrade price. Releveling with no actual stat change is unavailable. Previews use the same destination and quote as the committed transaction. Charm enchanting keeps the first affix within its theme; a targeted reroll can retain that stat and reroll its strength when no alternative fits.

## Skill reset

Enchanters offer Reset skills at 25 gold per spent tree/rank point, without level or repeat-use premiums. The service previews cost and refunds all purchased skill points, clearing bindings, rank selections, specializations and Overload. Attributes and gear remain unchanged. Wallet and build persist together before commitment; failed saves retain the old build. See [specification](expeditions.md).
