Updated 2026-09-07. Use the current guides for implementation. Proposed designs and historical captures are labeled separately; they do not override current code or user decisions.

## Town economy

[NPCs and vendors](npcs-and-vendors.md) documents implemented blacksmith trading/+10 enhancement, jeweler stock and enchanting. Prices, stock weights and enhancement strength are initial playtest defaults. [Service captures](captures/2026-09-05/town-services/README.md) show the shared panels and NPC art.

## Next iteration specifications

- [Character editor feasibility](character-editor-feasibility.md): source-based assessment of creation-time appearance, modular hair/skin/accessories, body presets, rendering integration and save implications; historical proposal, with the selected MVP now integrated.
- [Character editor MVP mockup](character-editor-mockup.md): local appearance study using the real rig, paged hair/skin options, armor tints and the inventory editor entry; save-free harnesses now share the production component.
- [Smartphone editor mockups](http://127.0.0.1:5173/character-editor-phone.html): interactive Character, Armor and Inventory phone studies with a persistent preview and touch-sized editing controls; local server required.

- [Journeys and local leads](procedural-journeys.md): proposed procedural adventures, light onboarding, level-aware routing, journal and reward/persistence rules.

- [Town portals and waypoints](travel-and-portals.md): implemented town return/home anchors; permanent waypoint network still specified.
- [Exploration, events and dungeons](dungeons-and-events.md): proposed encounter density, new enemy roles, interactive landmarks, procedural crypt floors, bosses and persistent expedition rewards.

Interactive POIs, town portals and dungeon expeditions are live. Permanent waypoint travel and regional Journey chains remain specified; single-site Journeys are implemented.

## Original vision and design exploration

[Game brief](game-brief.md), [world and art](world-and-art.md), [combat and progression](combat-and-progression.md), [technical foundations](technical-foundations.md), and [retro art direction](retro-art-direction.md) preserve the initial vision/proposals. Their proposed content counts, renderer choices, active-slot counts, sanctuary difficulty tiers, settings and migration ideas are not current requirements. Current guides and explicit user decisions supersede them.

[HUD directions](hud-directions.md) records the three art studies and selection of Astral. [Concept images](concepts/README.md) are generated visual references, not game assets.

[Creature death animations](creature-death-animations.md) records the 36 shared gameplay/review animations, four per current creature and boss, and the random selection rule.

## Historical evidence

- [Foundation checkpoints](history/foundation-checkpoints.md): older successive implementation/test snapshots, preserved with original numbers.
- [Early prototype](prototype-status.md): the initial slice before character saves and later world/combat work.
- [Expansion review](architecture-review-2026-09-05.md): pre-refactor assessment; its first three recommendations were implemented.
- [NPC readiness review](npc-vendor-readiness.md): assessment and completed item/panel consolidation; a historical pre-implementation assessment, now followed by atomic saved transactions.
- [Living forest study](living-forest.md): original motion pass and recording, later generalized to all biomes.
- [README screenshots](screenshots/README.md) and [capture gallery](captures/2026-09-05/README.md): staged evidence at capture time. Older loadouts, UI and maps are not claims about the latest playable save or visuals.

## Keeping this current

When a system changes, update its guide and any affected controls/catalog entry. Update status counts from `npm run stats`; record which checkpoint actually passed `npm run check`. Update the roadmap when a deliverable becomes implemented. Keep old numbers in historical records rather than appending contradictory “current” sections. Link to authoritative tables instead of copying balance values into unrelated docs.

Code checks and static reviews do not establish gameplay feel, economy balance or Safari performance. The player tests gameplay. Commit and push documentation with coherent code checkpoints.
