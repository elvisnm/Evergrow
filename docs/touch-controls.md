# Touch gameplay and interface

Implemented 2026-09-06. The earlier [audit](touch-controls-audit.md) records the starting problems and proposed acceptance scenarios. This implementation adds a device-specific input and presentation layer; combat rules, item transactions, character saves and desktop bindings remain shared.

## Activation and controls

Devices whose primary pointer is coarse show touch controls automatically. A real touch also enables them on hybrid devices. Intentional mouse/pen input, physical gameplay keys or gamepad input restores the desktop/controller presentation. Typing in native text fields does not switch the layout. There is no new settings screen, display filter or save format.

| Control | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Left movement disc | Drag in any direction for analog movement, independently of aiming |
| Right aim/attack stick | Hold to repeat the basic attack; drag around its fixed center to face and aim through 360°. The bounded silver thumb moves with the drag and recenters on release; last facing is retained |
| Five skill buttons | Touch and drag to aim, then release; self-centered skills can simply be tapped |
| Cancel target | Drag a skill finger into Cancel and release to discard its preview without spending mana |
| Potion | Tap to use the existing dual potion; shows charges and cooldown |
| Dodge | Tap to dodge along movement or current facing; shows charges |
| Interact | Use the existing nearby interaction resolver; a tap on a nearby world object also works |
| Portal | Start the town channel, tap again to cancel; in sanctuary locate the return portal |
| Character / skills / journeys / map / pause | Dedicated touch menu buttons |
| Camera | Pinch with two free fingers on the world, or use zoom buttons in Pause |
| Sound | Touch-only sound control in Pause, using the same N-key preference |

Aim persists between attacks. Skill aiming temporarily takes ownership from the basic-attack finger while movement remains available. All five slots retain their original assignments; empty slots do nothing. Resource cost, gear compatibility, action recovery and cooldown still go through the existing combat rules. Aiming in a monster’s direction selects a nearby visible foe inside a 56-degree forward cone. A modest retention bias keeps the target steady; moving the aim away releases it. Directional basics and skills share this assistance, while ground/self skills retain manual placement. Targets behind walls or outside the screen are excluded; released projectiles never home.

`touch-input.ts` owns bounded contact IDs, analog vectors, aim ownership and one-shot edges. `touch-targeting.ts` classifies every resolved skill recipe, including specializations. `skill-target-point.ts` is the shared ground-target range/obstruction calculation used by combat and previews. Preview circles and direction lines render after world post-processing.

## UI workflows

On touch, the character window has Bag, Equipment and Stats tabs. Tap an item to open its scrollable shared stat/comparison card. Equip buttons name the destination, including main/off hand and rings when eligible. Unequip and Move use the same validated character commands as desktop. Move highlights valid destinations; tap a destination to move or swap, or Cancel. Reserved 2H slots explain why they are occupied. Desktop hover, Shift-click and drag/drop are retained.

Both maps and the skill atlas use `touch-gesture.ts` and `touch-canvas.ts` for touch-only pan, pinch and tap. Existing mouse and wheel handlers remain in place. Pinch tracks the midpoint and transitions back to one finger without jumping; a pinch or drag never selects a point. Tapped map information remains visible until another gesture or dismissal. Skill selection opens the actual inspector, including allocation, rank/specialization, mastery, Overload and all five assignment positions. Touch slot numbers correspond to the five combat buttons.

Services retain inspect-then-confirm buying, selling and improvements. Native selectors, save-backed command guards and full comparison detail remain shared. Hall forms retain all eight slots, six starters and editable/randomizable world seeds. Native keyboards are supported, with viewport-height updates while editing. Busy hall actions lock duplicate input; service changes are guarded during durable transactions.

Touch styles are scoped to `.touch-mode`. Menus, inventory, services, the atlas, journeys and event choices have scrollable layouts for small/short viewports. Safe-area margins protect the controls. Phone landscape and very narrow touch layouts omit the mini journey tracker while retaining a translucent minimap. Its top aligns with the compact navigation trigger so it does not compete with the centered enemy plate. Its full panel remains accessible from the retractable menu. Desktop HUD artwork and targets remain unchanged. Touch keeps the shared delayed XP rail/reward landing point with enlarged level/XP lettering and uses the same animated life/mana glass, calibrated silver rings and suspended numeric plates in a compact footer, with separate thumb controls. Resource meters remain accessible in the DOM without drawing duplicate bars over the top-left counters.

Mobile/coarse-pointer browsers and the Android WebView use a `0.8` presentation-density profile captured at startup. The DOM viewport keeps its physical CSS dimensions and the existing world/UI buffer policies remain unchanged; the renderer exposes 1.25× the logical field in each dimension and scales its Canvas presentation without changing gameplay `CameraZoom`. Switching between touch and a physical controller does not reset this profile. The persistent secondary-menu targets remain at least 44 CSS pixels even where visual density is reduced.

The compact HUD uses 40px skill and utility buttons, a 72px attack pad and a 108px movement disc. Portrait places a 48px colored menu trigger on the left, centered over the first Interact/Portal button, and aligns its top with the translucent minimap on the right, leaving a small gap below the target plate. Pause remains a separate target below the trigger. The trigger opens the same five-destination list as the desktop HUD: Character, Inventory, Skill tree, Journeys and World map. Standard phone landscape stacks Menu and Pause above Interact/Portal; the visible button faces share a common left edge, and the destination list opens beside the trigger as it does in portrait. Character opens Stats and Inventory opens Bag directly. Touch buttons use the Astral HUD’s inset silver and black-steel framing. All bottom controls leave a dedicated clearance band for the resource orbs, existing XP rail, numeric readouts and accumulating XP caption; reward flights retain their shared landing coordinates. In both orientations, the movement and attack circles share the same horizontal center line. Interact/Portal sits above the movement disc with an 8px gap; its top may sit slightly above the highest skill button to preserve that spacing. In landscape, the life/mana HUD shares the player’s horizontal center and the minimap returns to the safe top-right corner. Enemy and boss plates stay centered at the top on touch; phone landscape halves the prior top gap while preserving the safe-area inset. The local touch study includes a staged target plate for layout feedback. Desktop geometry is unchanged.

Touch panel chrome uses 40px header rows, 16px titles, 20px emblems and 32px close/toolbar controls. In landscape the character’s Bag/Equipment/Stats tabs share its title row; narrow portrait layouts wrap them below. Inventory section spacing and the XP footer are compact, leaving more height for actual items. Header labels suppress native text selection/callouts, while search and form inputs retain text editing. Desktop panel sizing stays unchanged.

## Browser gestures and Home Screen launch

Touch presentation suppresses text selection, long-press callouts and browser double-tap zoom across game surfaces. Native inputs keep editing and text selection; panel scrolling and the game/map/atlas pinch handlers remain intact. Input-scoped selection/context/double-click default guards do not synthesize clicks or intercept touchend.

The web app manifest and Apple metadata configure a Home Screen launch without Safari’s browser bars. On iPhone use Share → Add to Home Screen, leave Open as Web App enabled, and launch that icon. A regular Safari tab cannot be forced into this mode by the page. Pause includes a Home Screen reminder, or a user-triggered fullscreen button when the browser exposes the Fullscreen API. The app keeps safe-area layout and does not add a service worker or cache old builds offline. Desktop gestures remain unchanged.

## Phone landscape

Landscape viewports at least 600px wide and at most 500px tall use a shared CSS-pixel layout (`touch-layout.ts`). The 96px movement stick and 202×148px action cluster sit in opposite bottom corners inside safe areas. The Astral resource footer scales into the gap between them instead of lifting the controls above it. Gold and XP flights land at the same relocated counters. The target plate is a compact 173×50px at the top, and top-left counters respect the notch inset.

The colored navigation trigger and Pause form a vertical column above Interact/Portal. Their visible 40px faces align to the left edge of its first button, and the column is centered in the open space between the gold header and Interact/Portal. The destination list opens beside the trigger and is height-bounded when landscape space is short. The mini journey tracker is omitted in this layout; a reduced translucent minimap remains visible for orientation. One compact pickup notification is shown below the target plate. Safari visual-viewport changes resize the shell, world buffer, native UI and touch geometry together. The static touch study uses the same presentation policy and layout. These are code-checked bounds, not a claim of physical iPhone acceptance.

## State and lifecycle safety

`Game.clearInput`, phase changes, durable transactions, focus loss and visibility changes cancel touch ownership along with existing keyboard/gamepad input. Touch UI hides immediately outside play and during blocking saves. Rotation, viewport changes, map closure and input-mode switches cancel captures. Old pointer moves/releases cannot recreate cleared actions.

Releasing basic attack clears its queued repeat without interrupting a committed swing. Capture cancellation discards queued touch actions. A skill finger owns its own aim while another finger holds attack. Panels, native inputs and camera gestures do not pass their touches through as mouse attacks. Sound unlock is attempted from a direct touch gesture.

The renderer preserves aspect ratio on narrow touch screens without changing the desktop minimum logical width. Character creation, travel and save data are unchanged; no character-progress reset is required.

## Verification and remaining acceptance

`/touch.html` is a local, save-free responsive layout study using the actual renderer, native UI canvas, touch controls and seeded starting area. Its touch presentation stays active during desktop mouse navigation. `?panel=inventory`, `?panel=skills` and `?panel=map` open the real panels with staged data. It never advances gameplay or accesses character saves; mutation actions are intentionally inert. Viewport screenshots of this study establish layout only, not input or mobile performance correctness.

The full code suite passed after PR reconciliation (704 tests at this checkpoint). The touch suite includes twelve tests covering simultaneous analog movement/attack, aim arbitration, quick taps, cancel/capture loss, all ten phase transitions, pointer bounds, tap/pan/pinch discrimination, two-to-one pinch transitions, all twenty targeting recipes, obstructed ground targeting and attack-repeat cancellation. Two inventory integration tests additionally cover equipping and moving through filtered source mappings without losing items or acquisition order. Strict/core type checks and the production build pass. The build retains the existing large-bundle advisory.

No browser gameplay automation or physical-device gameplay test was performed. The user should check thumb reach, comfortable aiming distance, aiming while moving, long item cards, all skill targeting types, keyboard/rotation interruptions, and sustained combat on a phone/tablet. Those ergonomic and hardware-performance observations remain acceptance feedback, not claims established by the code tests.

## Inventory PR reconciliation

Integrated PR #2 (`0e61b26`), including compact sorting/filtering, Equip Best and its weapon-type confirmation, acquisition ordering, and LB/RB section navigation with gamepad A/X activation. Touch uses the same filtered source-index projection: empty destinations are actual empty bag cells, and inert filter placeholders cannot become destinations. Opening the shared sort/Equip Best popups closes any touch item card or pending move; reorganized items invalidate stale cards. Double-tap on touch never invokes desktop double-click equip. The desktop toolbar retains its compact styling; touch toolbar targets now use the user-requested compact 32px size. Switching input modes clears the touch card, and the controller resumes from the last selected inventory section.

The tab click handler matches only `button[data-touch-tab]`. The window's `data-touch-tab` attribute is layout state, not an action; matching it as an ancestor would swallow all inventory clicks, including desktop Sort, Equip Best and Close.
